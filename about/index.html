<h1>Chair's Welcome</h1>
<h2><img src="/images/Lloyd_Errol.jpg" alt="Errol Lloyd" width="160" height="241" class="alignright" /></h2>
<p>Welcome to the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Delaware!  Whether you are a prospective student, a current student, a parent, an alumnus, a researcher at another institution, an employer, or are just surfing the web, you will find something interesting and exciting in our undergraduate, graduate and research programs.</p>
<p>As has been the case for nearly two decades, the demand from industry for graduates trained in the computer sciences is very strong.    In light of that demand our department offers three undergraduate and four graduate degree programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>BS in computer science</li>
<li>BA in computer science</li>
<li>BS in information systems</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>MS in computer science</li>
  <li>MS in software engineering</li>
  <li>MS in bioinformatics and computational biology</li>
  <li>PhD in computer science</li>
</ul>
<p>Our various curriculums provide a breadth of knowledge in both practice and theory, while allowing students to take multiple courses in areas of particular interest to them. Many of our classes at both the undergraduate and graduate levels feature problem-based learning in which students work interactively in groups on the core course material and/or projects. Our faculty take a sincere interest in our students and are willing to go the extra step in helping a student with problems that may arise.  And, the quality of the teaching in our department is second to none, featuring eight faculty recipients of the University Excellence in Teaching Award (only given to four faculty each year among the nearly 1000 faculty at UD).</p>
<p>Our research programs, which involve both graduate and undergraduate students, are strong and growing with many exciting projects in diverse areas such as bioinformatics, software engineering, graphics and vision, networking, high performance computing, and natural language processing. Our faculty and students publish a large number of conference and journal papers each year and have received a number of &quot;best paper&quot; nominations and awards. Support for this research is provided through a multitude of research grants to our faculty from outside agencies such as the National Science Foundation, the US Army, the US Air Force, and the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>In conclusion, let me invite you to further explore our website to learn more about the exciting opportunities to be found in both our education and research programs. And, if you should find yourself in Newark, please stop in and say hello!</p>
<p><em>Errol Lloyd</em><br />Professor and Chair</p></div>
