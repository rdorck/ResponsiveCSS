<h1>Diversity</h1>
<p>The Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Delaware is committed to providing quality education to a diverse student population.</p>
<p>In the Department, 1 in 4 tenure track professors are women (4 full and 2 associates of 23). Over the past 3 years, 27% of graduate students have been female. The Faculty is also representative of diverse cultures.</p>
<p><img src="/images/ncwitaa.jpg" width="124" height="111" alt="NCWIT Academic Alliance" class="alignright" />The Department is working on various programs for recruiting and retaining underrepresented groups in computing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ncwit.org/alliance.academic.html">NCWIT Academic Alliance</a>. Our department is a member of the NCWIT Academic Alliance. NCWIT is the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology, a 501(c)(3)* coalition that works to increase diversity in IT and computing.</li>
<li>Our faculty serve as research mentors to summer undergraduate researchers through the <a href="http://www.cra-w.org/dreu.html">CRA-W/CDC Distributed Research Experiences for Undergraduates</a> program, which has the goal of increasing the number of women and underrepresented groups entering graduate studies in the fields of computer science and engineering.</li>
<li>Our Department is committed to financially support (along with the Dean's office) a cohort of early college CS majors to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing each year. (See <a href="http://www.udel.edu/udaily/2012/dec/computer-networking-120811.html">UDaily Article</a> on one recent trip) The event is a series of sessions that include leading researchers presenting their current work and special sessions that focus on the role of women in today's computer science, information technology, research and engineering fields.</li>
<li>The women undergraduates and graduates lead a <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~cisters/wiki-cisters/pmwiki.php">CISTERS</a> group and participate regularly in the College of Engineering's <a href="http://www.engr.udel.edu/wie/index.html">Women in Engineering</a> activities, including brown bag lunches, speakers, and social events.</li>
<li>The department regularly offers a service learning course, Learning Game Development, in which student teams practice their software engineering skills in designing and implementing learning games for middle school teachers and their students at the Chester Community Charter School in Chester, PA (a high-crime, high poverty community).  This is an opportunity for students to help broaden participation in computing. The development of this course was funded by the National Science Foundation Broadening Participation in Computing program. More details can be found at <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/computeteams4youth/">Compute Teams 4 Youth</a>.</li></ul>

<p>Faculty in the Department are active in diversity-related initiatives for broadening participation in computing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Faculty advise students as part of the <a href="http://www.gemfellowship.org/">GEM Fellowship program</a>.</li>
<li>Faculty present and participate in the <a href="http://www.engr.udel.edu/rise/index.html">RISE</a> 5-week Summer academic bridge program to recruit and encourage academically prepared students who are native-born African American, Hispanic American, and Native American, as well as others who, as a group, are underrepresented in engineering.</li>
<li>Faculty have attended the Faculty Recruiting and Faculty Mentoring programs developed by the NSF sponsored <a href="http://www.engr.udel.edu/advance/index.html">UD ADVANCE</a> program to increase the representation of, and improve the climate for, women faculty in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.</li>
<li>Cavazos coordinates a program for the Coalition to Diversity Computing (CDC) called &quot;<a href="http://www.cdc-computing.org/programs/current-programs/students-to-conferences/">Sending Students and Mentors to Technical Conferences</a>,&quot; which sends underrepresented students to technical conferences.</li>
<li>Cavazos and Pollock co-organized a Discipline-specific Mentoring Workshop at University of Delaware. Cavazos has co-organized additional discipline-specific workshops in other locations. The main goal of these workshops is to encourage underrepresented students to attend graduate school.</li>
<li>Pollock co-organizes the <a href="http://cra-w.org/ArticleDetails/tabid/77/ArticleID/55/Default.aspx">CRA-W Graduate Cohort program</a> annually which aims to increase the ranks of senior women in computing by building and mentoring nationwide communities of women through their graduate studies.</li>
<li>Pollock serves regularly on the Academic Advisory Board for the <a href="http://gracehopper.org/2012/">Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing</a> (also served as General and Program Cochair).</li></ul>
