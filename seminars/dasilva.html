<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cloud computing went from &quot;the IT fad of the moment&quot; to being recognized as a revolutionary and effective approach to deliver computing services. In this talk we analyze cloud computing from the perspective of system software, exploring how this new model impacts current practices in operating systems and distributed computing. We identify a set of exciting research opportunities in resource management for cloud computing and discuss how cloud computing itself affects the way we carry out research projects.</p>
