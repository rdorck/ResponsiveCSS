<h1>Graduate</h1><br />
<h2>Graduate Program in Bioinformatics</h2>
<p>Bioinformatics is a growing area of research interest in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Delaware. The department, an active participant in the Delaware Biotechnology Initiative, has five faculty members currently engaged in research in this area, applying their expertise in machine learning, distributed artificial intelligence, computer vision, and natural language processing to address a wide variety of biological problems.</p>
<p>In addition, the Department of Computer and Information Sciences is also the academic home of the Center for Bioinformatics &amp; Computational Biology (CBCB). The CBCB is an interdisciplinary, cross-campus and inter-institutional initiative for the Delaware research and education community, and is built on the Bioinformatics core at the Delaware Biotechnology Institute (DBI) and the Bioinformatics infrastructure of the Protein Information Resource (PIR). Students who are interested in Bioinformatics can apply directly to the Graduate programs in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. These programs are administered through the Department of Computer &amp; Information Sciences, and are coordinated by the CBCB.</p>
<p>Current projects include identifying protein homologues such as immune system enhancers and transporter proteins, building automated annotation systems, inferring genetic networks and their evolution, analyzing images of microarrays, and protein docking, and text-mining information such as protein-protein and protein-drug interactions from biomedical literature. These projects are supported by grants from NSF, NIH, USDA, and the US Army.</p>
