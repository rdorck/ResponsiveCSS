<h1>Graduate</h1>
<h2>Admission Requirements<img src="/images/CIS_Grad_Students_099.jpg" width="300" height="200" align="right" /></h2>
<p>The following are the general requirements for admission to the graduate program in the CIS Department:</p>
<ol>
<li>A bachelor's degree at a recognized four-year college or university. A minimum grade average of 3.2 in the major field of study and an overall cumulative index of 3.0 is required.</li>
<li>All applicants to our graduate program are expected to have scholarly competence in mathematics and computer programming. If you do not have a degree in computer science or a related area, you must have taken <a href="#basic">these basic undergraduate courses in computer science and math</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#gre">GRE test scores</a></li>
<li>For foreign applicants: <a href="#toefl">TOEFL test scores</a></li>
<li>Three letters of recommendation from professors (preferably), employers, or others who have had a supervisory relationship with you and are able to assess your potential for success in graduate studies.</li>
<li>It is suggested, but not required, that students provide official documentation of their relative ranking within their class.</li></ol>
<p><strong>A Master's degree is not required for admission to the PhD program. Strong applicants with a Bachelor's degree are encouraged to apply directly for admission to the PhD program.</strong></p>
<p>Note: Admission to the graduate program is competitive. Those who meet stated minimum requirements are not guaranteed admission, nor are those who fail to meet all of those requirements necessarily precluded from admission if they offer other appropriate strengths.</p>
