<h3><a href="http://www.engr.udel.edu/softwareengineering/" target="_blank">UD's Master of Science in Software Engineering (MSSE) Program</a></h3>
<p>UD's Master of Science in Software Engineering (MSSE) program prepares students for a professional career as a practicing software engineer. Graduates can expect to have expanded career options and responsibilities involving any or all aspects of software engineering. A key feature is the flexibility the program offers, with student-chosen specializations as well as the option of creating a customized track to fit specific work/career responsibilities. Moreover, degree completion includes a practicum experience tailored to the student's technical interests, enabling the student to use creative and critical thinking skills while contributing to a problem-solving software engineering team in a real-life setting.</p>

<h3><a href="http://bioinformatics.udel.edu/Education/PhD" target="_blank">PhD Program in Bioinformatics &amp; Systems Biology</a></h3>
<p>The Ph.D. in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology is offered as a university-wide interdisciplinary graduate program with scientific curriculum that builds upon the research and educational strength from departments across the Colleges of Engineering (CoE), Arts &amp; Sciences (CAS), Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources (CANR), and Earth, Ocean &amp; Environment (CEOE). The Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CBCB) administers the Ph.D. program in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology and coordinates with the individual Departments involved in the program.</p>

<h3><a href="http://bioinformatics.udel.edu/Education" target="_blank">Master Program in Bioinformatics &amp; Systems Biology</a></h3>
<p>This Master's program in Bioinformatics &amp; Computational Biology with SIX degree options in THREE major categories supports students from different educational backgrounds and with different career aspirations, while leveraging the common course curriculum. The students, full-time or part time, come from various biological, life sciences background, from computational, quantitative sciences and engineering background, or even from &quot;unconventional&quot; fields such as business, management, law and medicine. We accommodate students that are interested in applying bioinformatics as an integral approach to life science research and development, or interested in developing new computational methods and bioinformatics tools and databases.</p>
