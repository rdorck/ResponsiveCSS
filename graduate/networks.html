<h2>Graduate Program in Computer Networks</h2>
<p>Computer Networks and Distributed Computing is a major area of research and study in the Graduate Program of the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Delaware. With three full-time faculty, networking research has been a prominent part of the Department's activities, and a focal point of collaboration with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. As a result, the Networking group has been able to utilize the combined resources of the two Departments, taking advantage of each one's strengths. This interaction was highlighted by a Federated Research Laboratory in Telecommunications/Information Distribution (ATIRP), involving the U.S. Army Research Laboratories and a consortium of industrial and academic partners, including the University of Delaware CIS and ECE Departments. During 1996-2001, this award brought more than $1.6 million to our department (and a like amount to ECE), and supported a wide range of networking research. The combination of resources in the CIS Department and the ECE Department provide an environment that is most conducive to making the University of Delaware one of the top networking research centers in the country.</p>
<p>For the period 2001-2011, the CISC and ECE Departments were part of a U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA) in Communications and Networking. The Army Research Laboratory's strategy was to exploit commercial technology and expertise by establishing industrial/academic consortia that work closely with ARL scientists and engineers to help fulfill critical Army modernization objectives. This CTA brought together seventeen university and industrial partners to collaborate in four general research areas: Survivable Wireless Mobile Networks, Signal Processing for Communications-on-the-Move, Secure Jam-Resistant Communications, and Tactical Information Protection. Principal investigators directing UD's research effort were CISC Professors Paul Amer, Errol Lloyd, and Adarsh Sethi, and ECE Professors Gonzalo Arce and Charles Boncelet. Additional participating faculty include: CIS Professors Lori Pollock, and Chien-Chung Shen, and ECE Professors Javier Garcia-Frias, and Xiang Gen Xia.</p>
<p>The Army allocated $76.3M for the Communications and Networking Alliance. Of this total, CISC and ECE equally shared $5-6M, and supported approximately fourteen graduate research assistants per year. This CTA grant represents the largest single contract the CIS Department ever received. Being part of the winning alliance proposal demonstrated how strongly and how successfully the CIS and EE collaborate. The two departments have worked closely ever since they received an NSF equipment grant in 1985 to establish a joint EE-CIS computing facility connecting three DEC VAX machines with one of the world's first Ethernets.</p>
<p>The current major thrusts of the Department's networking research are in the areas of Transport Layer Services and Protocols (e.g., SCTP); Network management; Flow and congestion control; Protocols for packet radio and wireless environments; High performance computing; Dynamic spectrum access networks; Mobile ad hoc and wireless sensor networks; Bio-inspired swarming and networking protocols; Network security; Performance modeling and analysis; and Multimedia data compression.  Industrial partners supporting these topics include Google, Cisco, and Adara Networks.</p>
