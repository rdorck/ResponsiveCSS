<h2>Graduate Program in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval</h2>
<p>Natural language processing and information retrieval constitute a major area of research and graduate study in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Delaware. Current research interests center on strategies for understanding and the generation of descriptions of multimodal documents (i.e., documents containing information graphics), anaphora understanding and generation, , the development of robust dialogue systems, retrieval of novel and diverse URLs in web search, search over sessions of user interactions, electronic health record retrieval and analysis, statistical and corpus-based approaches to natural language processing, experimental design and statistical analysis for NLP and IR, text mining of life sciences documents, text summarization,  and applying natural language processing techniques to assistive technologies for people with disabilities (particularly those with severe speech or sight impairments). Members of our NLP group have served on or currently serve on the editorial boards of ACM Transactions on Information Systems, ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing, Computational Linguistics Journal, Information Retrieval, International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, ISRN Artificial Intelligence, Journal of Dialog Systems, Grammars and User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction. They have served for many years as officers of the Association for Computational Linguistics, have served as general and program chair for several major conferences, and extensively serve on program committees and as workshop organizers. Research projects have been supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute for Disability Research and Rehabilitation, National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA), and the US Army Research Lab.</p>
