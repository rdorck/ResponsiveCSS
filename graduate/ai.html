<h1>Graduate</h1><br />
<h2>Graduate Program in Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>Multi-agent systems, knowledge representation, computer vision, and intelligent tutoring systems are areas of research interest in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Delaware. In addition, a Cognitive Science Program brings in well-known speakers from throughout North America and serves as a forum for joint research efforts with faculty from the departments of Educational Studies, Linguistics, and Psychology. Members of our AI group serve on the editorial boards of International Journal of Man-Machine Studies, Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems Journal, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction Journal, Machine-Mediated Learning, and Visible Language. In addition, they have served on the program committees for major conferences in artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems.</p>
<p>Multi-Agent Systems and Distributed Artificial Intelligence research deals with the issues that arise when groups or societies of autonomous agents (usually computer programs but sometimes people too) interact to solve problems. These agents may be self-interested, or cooperating to solve a shared problem. Important issues include reasoning about the knowledge and beliefs of other agents, communication and negotiation, and coordination and control. Furthermore, in many real-world problems agents have limited computational resources available to them, and so must forgo optimal solutions for satisfying solutions.</p>
<p>Knowledge representation, planning, problem-solving, and plan recognition are important components of intelligent systems, especially systems that must react to their environment or interact with other agents, and several researchers are pursuing work in these areas. In addition, the video modeling and synthesis lab is studying a number of major problems in computer vision and image processing, with an emphasis on the modeling of non-rigid body motion.</p>
