<h1>Graduate Academic Programs</h1><br />
<p>
The Department of Computer and Information Sciences offers programs leading to the PhD and MS degrees in Computer Science.  In addition, the department participates in inter-disciplinary graduate programs <!--in software engineering and -->in bioinformatics and systems biology.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Computer Science Graduate Programs (<a href="academics.html">overview</a>)
 <ul>
 <li><b> <a href="http://www.cis.udel.edu/graduate/academics.html#ms">Master of Science in Computer Science</a></b><br>
The MS program prepares students for doctoral studies or for professional employment. 
It is normally completed in four semesters of full-time study, 
 <li> <a href="http://www.cis.udel.edu/graduate/academics.html#phd"><b>Ph.D. in Computer Science</a></b><br>
 The PhD is designed to prepare students, for academic careers and for careers in government and industry research labs.
 </ul>
<li> Cross-cutting Graduate Programs
 <ul>
 <!--
 <li> <a href="http://www.engr.udel.edu/softwareengineering/"><b>Master of Science in Software Engineering</a></b><br>
 The MS in Software Engineering program prepares students for a professional career as a practicing software engineer. Graduates can expect to have expanded career options and responsibilities involving any and all aspects of software development.
 -->
 <li> <a href="http://bioinformatics.udel.edu/Education/MS"><b>Master of Science in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology</a></b><br>
 The thesis-based MS degree prepares students for advanced research. The Computational Sciences Concentration (CS) allows students with strong quantitative sciences background to gain knowledge and research experience in developing computational methods and bioinformatics tools and databases for the study of biological systems.
 <li> <a href="http://bioinformatics.udel.edu/Education/PhD"><b>Ph.D. in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology </a></b><br>
 The Ph.D. in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology will train the next-generation of researchers and professionals who will play a key role in multi- and interdisciplinary teams, bridging life sciences and computational sciences.  Students who complete this degree will be able to generate and analyze experimental data for biomedical research as well as develop physical or computational models of the molecular components that drive the behavior of the biological system. 
<li> Certificate Programs<br>
  <ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.math.udel.edu/CinCSE/"><b>CSE-Cert</a></b><br>
 The Certificate in Computational Science and Engineering is a an exciting opportunity to develop your computational skills as part of a degree program or as part time study if you already have a career going. 
  <li> <a href="http://bioinformatics.udel.edu/Education/Certificate"><b>BINF-Cert</a></b><br>
	The Bioinformatics Graduate Certificate is ideally suited for working professionals who cannot make a commitment to a MS or PSM program at this time, but can use the Certificate as a stepping stone. The Certificate can also complement other UD graduate  degree programs, allowing current graduate students to gain bioinformatics knowledge and skills.
