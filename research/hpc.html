<h2>Core Research Area in High Performance Computing</h2>
<img src="/images/hpc.jpg" height="200" width="300" alt="" class="alignright" />
<p>High performance computing (HPC) is an established area of research and graduate study in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Delaware (UD). HPC at UD embraces several research aspects including parallel and distributed programming; programming languages and compilers; optimization and scheduling of large-scale scientific applications; software validation, verification, and testing; and algorithms and tools for exact linear algebra computation on large dense and sparse matrix problems. Parallel and distributed programming aims to enhance performance through the process of performing parts of a task concurrently. Achieving the performance gains projected for applications through parallelism offered by today's parallel and distributed systems mandates new paradigms for system software (i.e., operating systems, languages, compilers, computer architecture, and programming tools) and the redesign of applications software through the development, implementation, optimization, verification, and testing of parallel and concurrent algorithms.</p>
<p>Advanced cyberinfrastructure available to faculty and their groups at UD include high-end, multi-core supercomputer on campus and from <a href="https://www.xsede.org/" target="_blank">XSEDE</a>. Targeted platforms include cloud computing, multi-threading and GPU computing, and volunteer computing. New challenges include moving scientific applications and their execution beyond peta-scale architectures into the new era of exa-scale platforms; designing new algorithms both compute- and data-intensive applications; exploring and adapting new paradigms such as MapReduce for the latter application. Research projects have been supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy (DoE), the US Air Force Organization (USAF), the US Army Research Organization (ARO), Google, DARPA, JP Morgan, and CERDEC.</p>
