<p>Network management involves the design of techniques for the monitoring and
  control of computer networks to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization.
  We focus on fault management whose aim is to detect, diagnose, localize, and
  recover from hardware and software failures and performance bottlenecks that
  may plague a network. We are also interested in the management of wireless
  networks including methods for managing mobility to provide seamless operation
  of network services.<br />
  In network optimization we aim to provide provably optimal or near optimal
  solutions to a range of power specification and control problems arising in
  wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. The primary focus is on topology control
  (assigning power levels to network nodes so as to achieve a specified network
  topology) in both stationary and mobile networks. Additional work includes
  the study of relay node placement and of power back off as a collision resolution
  mechanism.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><br />

  algebra computation. Exact linear algebra with matrices of integers is harder
  than the more widely used approximate linear algebra in floating point.  Our
  work contributes to LinBox, a software library for solving exact systems exactly.
  It is developed by a team of researchers in the US, France, and Canada<br />
   </p>
<p><strong>Multi Agent Systems Laboratory (MAS Lab)</strong></p>
<p><strong>447 Smith Hall, Professor Keith Decker.</strong></p>
<p>An agent is a computer system capable of flexible, autonomous action in dynamic
  multi-agent environments. The success of the Internet has shown that computing
  is no longer only about fast numerical calculation, or isolated information
  processing. It is now also about interaction and coordination amongst machines,
  and between machines and people. The MAS laboratory focuses on the science
  of coordination in applications ranging from distributed energy management
  and emergency response support to scientific information gathering.<br />
   </p>
<p><strong>Human Language Technologies Laboratory</strong></p>
<p><strong>100 Elkton Road, Professors Sandra Carberry and Kathy McCoy.</strong></p>
<p>The Human Language Technology Laboratory is an umbrella for two language-related
  laboratories: disabilities technology and discourse. The laboratory closely
  collaborates with the Statistical Information Retrieval Laboratory and the
  Text Mining Laboratory.</p>
<p>The Disabilities Technology Laboratory, directed by Kathy McCoy, develops
  intelligent interfaces for people with disabilities that affect their ability
  to communicate. The ICICLE System is an intelligent English grammar checker
  and tutor for people who are deaf. Other projects assist people who have special
  communication needs. We make &quot;talking with&quot; a computer faster and
  more natural. Another project is to help a person who has visual impairments &quot;scan&quot; a
  text to find the area relevant to answering a question.</p>
<p>The Discourse Laboratory, under the direction of Sandra Carberry, addresses
  problems related to discourse and dialogue. The Graphs project treats information
  graphics (bar charts, line graphs, etc.) as a form of discourse with a communicative
  goal. We are applying language understanding and generation techniques to index,
  store, and retrieve graphics from a digital library, to develop an interactive
  dialogue system that conveys the content of graphics via speech to individuals
  with sight impairments, and to develop an interactive graph design assistant
  that will critique graphs with the objective of improving them so that they
  achieve their communicative goal. Current collaborators include Dr. Stephanie
  Elzer (Millersville University), Dr. Dan Chester, and graduate students.<br />
   </p>
<p><strong>Statistical Information Retrieval Laboratory</strong></p>
<p><strong>77/79 East Delaware Ave, Professor Ben Carterette.</strong></p>
<p>The Statistical Information Retrieval Laboratory pursues novel models of information
  organization, storage, access, retrieval, and integration using statistical
  and information-theoretic approaches. One of the key problems in developing
  such models is that optimizing and evaluating their utility requires human
  input. We aim to minimize the human cost, or to accomplish much more with an
  allotted cost, thereby allowing research and development to proceed much faster.<br />
   </p>
<p><strong>Text Mining Laboratory</strong></p>
<p><strong>102 Smith Hall, Professor Vijay Shanker.</strong></p>
<p>The Text Mining Laboratory, directed by Vijay Shanker, is concerned with the
  development of language technology algorithms to assist scientists to rapidly
  access relevant information from research literature. Projects include the
  extraction of targeted information, retrieval of relevant textual passages,
  and assistance in the knowledge discovery process. A related project involves
  rapid adaptation of language processing tools that were developed for a general
  domain to be used in a specific domain. A third project involves multi-disciplinary
  effort that integrates natural language cues found in large software programs
  and program analysis for multiple software development and maintenance tasks.<br />
   </p>
<p><strong>Computational Learning Laboratory</strong></p>
<p><strong>342 Smith Hall, Professor John Case.</strong></p>
<p>The members of the Computational Learning Laboratory do theoretical, mathematical
  work regarding abstract machine models of, among other things, learning and
  self-modeling.<br />
