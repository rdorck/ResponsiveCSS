<h1>Undergraduate</h1>
<h2>The Computer Science Major (BA or BS)</h2>
<h3>The Computer Science Curriculum:</h3>
<img src="/images/colonnade_smith.jpg" height="199" width="300" alt="" class="alignright" />
<p>To earn either a BS or a BA in computer science, students must complete at least 124 credits and meet specific requirements, as outlined in the University catalog at <a href="http://academiccatalog.udel.edu/Pub_ShowCatalogPage.aspx?CATKEY=KEY_2276&ACYEAR=2013-2014" target="_blank">requirements for BS degree in Computer Science</a> and at <a href="http://academiccatalog.udel.edu/Pub_ShowCatalogPage.aspx?CATKEY=KEY_2275&ACYEAR=2013-2014" target="_blank">requirements for BA degree in Computer Science</a>.</p>
<p>The courses for the BA degree and the BS degree are the same for the freshman and sophomore years, branching off into their respective emphasis for the last two years. The degree of BS in CS emphasizes technical aspects, with more required courses, including the concentration. The BA in CS has a liberal arts focus, with fewer required courses, and an opportunity to plan your own upper level study in consultation with an advisor.</p>
<h3>The Information Systems Curriculum:</h3>
<p>To earn a <a href="http://academiccatalog.udel.edu/Pub_ShowCatalogPage.aspx?CATKEY=KEY_2277&ACYEAR=2013-2014" target="_blank">BS in Information Systems</a>, students must complete at least 124 credits and meet specific requirements, as outlined in the University catalog at requirements for BS Degree in Information Systems.  The core curriculum in this major consists of required courses in both computer science and in business, with concentrations in business and in information systems. The business concentration consists of courses in accounting, finance, operations management, organizational behavior, and marketing. The information systems concentration consists of courses in technological problem solving, project management, and a selection from computer science courses such as algorithms, operating systems, computer architecture, artificial intelligence, computer graphics, etc. The computer science courses provide the student with expertise in programming, networks, system development, and software engineering. The business courses provide the student with expertise in management and financial matters and in technology deployment issues. Because this major already includes many courses in both computer science and management information systems, students in this major are not permitted to minor in CIS or MIS.</p>
