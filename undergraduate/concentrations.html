<h2>Concentrations for the BS Degree in Computer Science</h2>
<h3>Catalog description:</h3>
<p><em>CISC Concentration (12)</em> Twelve credits in advanced courses in an advisor-approved concentration. Students are encouraged to explore how other subject areas impact and are impacted by computer science. Concentration courses must be distinct from courses taken to satisfy other CISC requirements.</p>
<h3>What is a concentration?</h3>
<p>The concentration must be a coherent group of advanced courses that is relevant to integrating computer science with your career goals. Note that the concentration may consist solely of courses outside the CIS Department, or solely of courses within the CIS Department, or a combination of courses both inside and outside the CIS Department, but students are encouraged to select concentrations that involve courses outside of computer science. Students are encouraged to pursue a topic that transcends departmental boundaries, perhaps involving courses from multiple departments. The 12 credits in the concentration are intended to develop a student's knowledge in computer science and/or its relationships to other areas.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to pursue double majors or minors in other departments. In support of that, courses taken toward the major or minor in the other department can often be used as part of the concentration requirement for a Bachelor of Science in computer science.</p>
<h3>What courses are eligible for a concentration?</h3>
<p>Concentration courses should generally be advanced courses in a discipline, which is interpreted as a course numbered 300 and above or a course  having prerequisites of other courses in that Department. Advisor approval of a concentration is REQUIRED prior to taking a concentration course. Approval of a concentration is dependent on the coherence among the courses and the rationale for the concentration as being relevant to the student's career goals in computer science and the other courses selected by the student as technical electives.  For example, a student who is interested in applying his computer science expertise to the area of technical publications might have an approved concentration that involves courses from the English department and the Communications Department. A student who is interested in a business career might choose a concentration consisting of courses from the College of Business leading to a minor in Business Administration. The approval is dependent on the coherence among the courses as established by the rationale for the concentration.  On the other hand, a student who is interested in educational technology might have a concentration consisting of some courses from the CIS Department and some courses from the College of Education. Note that concentrations will not be approved just because a student wants to take courses in some other department --- the concentration must be relevant to the student's career goals for his computer science major.</p>
<h3>When and how do I get a concentration approved?</h3>
<p>The student should start a discussion with his/her advisor concerning the concentration during the sophomore year. This discussion should start with a topic area, and move on to developing a list of possible courses, and a rationale for the choices. After an agreed plan is reached with your advisor (generally by the end of the sophomore year), submit (1) your concentration title, (2) concentration course list, and (3) concentration rationale by email to your advisor who will enter it into the SIS+ advisor notes system. The course list must include 4 courses meeting the advanced course guidelines and form a coherent set of courses related to your computer science career goals. In case you are unsure which of several appropriate courses you may take in the future, it is acceptable to put some alternatives in the concentration course list, such as &quot;4 of these 5 courses&quot; or &quot;these two plus two of the following 4&quot;.</p>
<h3>Some sample concentrations:</h3>
<p>The following are some concentrations that have been approved or suggested over the last few years. These are examples of concentration subject areas and their rationale. Some courses are listed that fit in with that rationale. They are suggestions only. A concentration with the same or similar title could have different courses in it and a different rationale. Please be aware that some courses are not offered every semester (or even every year) and thus you may have difficulty fitting courses into your schedule at the last minute. This is one reason to start thinking about a concentration early.</p>
